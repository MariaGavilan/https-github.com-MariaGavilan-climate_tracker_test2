## Project Overview

This repository contains a complete suite of MATLAB tools for:

1. **Carbon Footprint Calculation:**  Measure emissions across transport, home energy, food, digital, and consumption
2. **Regional Context Analysis:**  Compare your footprint against regional and global averages
3. **Action Planning:**  Explore 50+ evidence-based reduction strategies
4. **Interactive Visualization:**  Web-based dashboard for real-time impact assessment
5. **Paris Agreement Alignment:**  Track progress toward 2030 climate targets


### Prerequisites

## What I Learned

Through this workshop at MATLAB EXPO 2025, I gained hands-on experience with:

-
-
-

### Technical Skills
- **MATLAB Programming**: Functions, data structures, file I/O, error handling
- **Data Analysis**: CSV processing, regional data aggregation, statistical comparisons
- **Web Development**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript integration with MATLAB via `uihtml`
- **Interactive UI Design**: Real-time updates, form validation, responsive layouts
- **Version Control**: Git fundamentals, GitHub workflow, collaborative development


### Key Insights
- **Geography Matters**: Same behavior has 24× different impact depending on electricity grid
- **Flight Impact**: A single transatlantic flight = 1.5 tons (75% of annual Paris target)
- **Diet Impact**: Switching to vegetarian diet can reduce food emissions by 33%
- **Transport Dominance**: Typically 25-40% of personal footprint in developed regions
- **Grid Transition**: Clean electricity enables electrification of transport and heating

## Example Results

### Personal Footprint Analysis (USA, Typical Commuter)
- **Total Annual Emissions**: 8.5 tons CO₂e
  - Transport: 
  - Home Energy: 
  - Food: 
  - Digital: 0.2 tons (2%) 
  - Consumption:

## Data Sources & Methodology

This project uses emission factors and regional data from authoritative sources:

- **Grid Intensity**: [Ember Global Electricity Review 2025](https://ember-climate.org/)
- **Transport Emissions**: UK DEFRA 2024, IPCC 2019 Guidelines
- **Food Emissions**: Poore & Nemecek (2018), Our World in Data
- **Digital Emissions**: IEA Digitalization & Energy 2024, The Shift Project
- **Regional Averages**: Global Carbon Project 2024, Our World in Data

All emission factors are CO₂-equivalent (CO₂e), including methane and N₂O using 100-year GWP.
